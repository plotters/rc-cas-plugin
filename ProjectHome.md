A plugin for the [RoundCube](http://roundcube.net/) webmail client that replaces the RoundCube login page with authentication requests to a CAS server, which enables logging into RoundCube with identities authenticated by the CAS server and acts as a CAS proxy to relay authenticated credentials to the IMAP backend.

Visit the [Guide](Guide.md) page for requirements and instructions on installing and configuring this plugin.
